# In Memory Caching Workload Analysis OSDI'20 

## Artifact Evaluation 
### Note
We used one-week trace in our analysis, which requires a lot of computation resources and long time, so for artifact evaluation, we provided two-day traces, if you are interested and have enough computation capability, we can provide full trace. 
Do note that, even the two-day traces require a large amount of computation, feel free to do the analysis using a subset from each trace. 


### Repo explanation 
* cacheTraceAnalysis folder contains all the scripts we use to compute the analysis and generate the figures.  
* JPlot is an internal plotting library 
* libCacheSim is the tool we use to run simulations 
* data folder contains some precomputed results 

### Data 
Data can been accessed at <https://ftp.pdl.cmu.edu/pub/datasets/twemcacheWorkload/twoDay/>. 
The data is binary in the following format, each trace contains a sequence of requests, each request is represented in 20 bytes: 
```
struct req {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint64_t obj_id; 
    uint32_t key_len:8; 
    uint32_t val_len:24;
    uint32_t op:8;
    uint32_t ttl:24;
} 
```

You do not need to write a reader for the trace, the scripts in the repo contains reader that can read the traces. 


### Trace Analysis  
Several figures are based on the statistics of the traces, to calculate the statistics for a trace, run 
`python3 evalTrace.py --trace /path/to/trace --type=trace_stat`, note that each trace stat can take hours to days to run. In the case of not having enough computation capacity, we have provided computed stat under `data/`. 


#### Fig 2 
These two figures are generated by querying production systems, so the plot data cannot be regenerated. 

#### Fig 3
this set of figures are plotted using 7-day traces, the two traces used are `ibis_api_cache` and `botmaker_2_cache`  
`python3 plot/reqRate.py --trace /path/to/ibis_api_cache.sbin`
`python3 plot/reqRate.py --trace /path/to/botmaker_2_cache.sbin`


#### Fig 4, 5, 9 
this set of figures are generated using one script, precomputed trace_stat is under `data/trace_stat.core.twoday` 
`python3 plot/traceStat.py --trace_stat /path/to/trace_stat`

#### Fig 6
This set of figures are also generated using the 7-day traces, the two traces used are `simclusters_core_cache`, and `pushservice_mh_cache`. 
the two traces used are xx, to plot the figures, run 
`python3 plot/workingset.py --trace /path/to/pinkfloyd_cache`
`python3 plot/workingset.py --trace /path/to/simclusters_core_cache`

#### Fig 7, 8, 11
Fig 7 is calculated and plot using `popularity.py`, which given a trace plots popularity-rank plot and output alpha and R2, which are used to plot Fig. 8, and Fig. 11. 

#### Fig 10 
Fig 10 are generated using 7 day traces, the four traces are onboarding_task_service_cache, timelines_content_features_cache, timelines_ranked_tweet_cache, ibis_api_cache 

to generate the figure run 
`python3 plot/sizeDistHeatmap.py --trace /path/to/trace`

#### Fig 12, 13, 14 
This set of figures are computed using libCacheSim (see below), you need to compile and install before running the simulations. 
The four traces in Fig 12 are media_metadata_cache, strato_negative_result, graph_feature_service, timelines_ranked_tweet. 


#### Simulation 
We use the libCacheSim (libMimircache) simulator <https://github.com/1a1a11a/libCacheSim>, one copy is contained in this repo under simulator. We added a Python binding for easy running and plotting. 
To compile the python3 extension you need to install glib-dev, numpy header, tcmalloc 
on Ubuntu you can install `sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev`
then run `python3 setup.py build_ext -i` in simulator folder to compile libCacheSim. 

Then run `python3 plot/simulator.py`
